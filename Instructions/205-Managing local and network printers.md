# Practice Lab: Managing local and network printers

## Summary

In this exercise, you will perform basic printer configuration. You will add a
local printer by using Devices and Printers. You then will configure printer
security, and use the Print Management tool to add a printer on a remote
computer. You also will connect to a remote printer, and then manage a print
job.

### Scenario

Marketing purchased a new printer that uses a Microsoft PCL6 Class Driver that’s
attached to LON-CL1. They also want to be able to share the printer but restrict
use to just the Managers group. There is a second printer attached to LON-CL2
that uses the Microsoft PS Class Driver, which is also to be shared with access
for everyone to print. After configuring, Beth will need to test that she can
only print to the printer on LON-CL2, and that print jobs initiated from LON-CL2
can be seen in the queue on LON-CL1.

    **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  In the taskbar, in the **Type here to search** text box, type **Control
    Panel**, and then select **Control Panel**.

3.  In Control Panel, select **View devices and printers**.

4.  In Devices and Printers, select **Add a printer**.

5.  In the **Add a device** dialog box, select **The printer that I want isn’t

    is selected, and then select **Remove**.

3.  Select **Add**, in the **Enter the object names to select (examples)** box,
    type **Managers**, and then select **OK**. In the **Permissions for
    Managers** section, verify that **Print** check box is selected in the
    **Allow** column, and then select **OK**.

 

### Task 3: Use Print Management to manage a remote printer

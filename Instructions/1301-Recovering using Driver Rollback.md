# Practice Lab: Recovering using Driver Rollback

## Summary

In this exercise you will learn how to do a Driver Rollback and Safe Mode to
repair a driver when the system is unusable.

### Scenario

You've been given a new keyboard driver to test on LON-CL1. As there is concern
it may fail, it's recommend to enable Picture password in case the keyboard is
unresponsive. In the even this happens, you'll need to use Safe Mode to correct
the issue.

### Task 1: Configure a picture password as a sign-in option

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password of
    **Pa55w.rd.**

2.  In L**ON-CL1**, select the **Start** icon, and then select **Settings**.

3.  In the **Settings** dialog box, select **Accounts**, select **Sign-in
    options**, and then in the **Picture password** section, select **Add**. In
    the **Windows Security** dialog box, enter **Pa55w.rd** as the password, and
    then select **OK**.

4.  In the Welcome to picture password window, select **Choose picture**, browse
    to **C:\\Windows\\Web\\Screen**, select **img100.jpg**, click **Open**, and
    then select **Use this picture**.

    picture. Remember which gestures you are using, as you will repeat them
    later to sign in!

6.  Repeat the pattern to confirm, select **Finish**, and then close the
    Settings window.

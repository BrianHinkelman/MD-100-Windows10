# Practice Lab: Using the Settings App and Control Panel


## Summary

In this lab you will learn how to modify computer settings using the Windows 10
Settings App and the Control Panel.

### Scenario

You need to use the Settings app to ensure that the antivirus program does not
scan the Util folder on drive (C:), because it contains some scripts that
deliberately trigger and test antivirus programs. Additionally, you will need to
create a new power plan that minimizes power usage, but does not impact sales
staff playing the presentations while on battery.

    remove exclusions.**

9.  Browse to **C:\\UTIL** and select **Select Folder**. In the User Account
    Control window select **Yes**.  
    _**Note**: C:\\Util is now listed as exclusion._

10. Close the Windows Security app.

11. Close the Settings app.

2.  In the Control Panel window select **Hardware and Sound** and then select
    **Power Options**.

4.  Enter "**Power Save - Presentation**" in the Plan Name field and select
    **Next**.

5.  Select **Create**.

6.  Under Preferred Plans, select **Change plan settings** next to the plan you
    created.

7.  Select C**hange advanced power settings**.

8.  Scroll down and expand the **Multimedia settings** option.

9.  Expand the **When playing video** option and confirm the setting **Optimize
    Video Quality**.

10. Select **Ok**.

# Practice Lab: Compressing Folders 

## Summary
In this lab you will learn how to save disk space using compressed folders.

### Scenario
You notice that on LON-CL3, the C:\Users on folder is taking quite an amount of storage. To reduce the required space you decide to compress the folder.
 
### Task 1: Verify current folder size
1.  Sign in to LON-CL3 as **LON-CL3\\Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**
2.  Select the **File Explorer** icon on the taskbar.
3.  Navigate to the **C:\\Users folder**. Right-click the **Admin folder**, and then select **Properties**.
4.  On the General tab, note the Size on Disk in megabytes (MB):__________\_

### Task 2: Configure compression on the folder
1.  On the General tab, select **Advanced**.
2.  Select **Compress contents to save disk space**, and then select **OK**.
3.  Select **Apply**, and then in the Confirm Attribute Changes window, select
    **OK**.  
_**Note**: If the Access Denied window appears, Select Continue. If the Error Applying
    Attributes window appears, select Ignore All._

### Task 3: Verify the storage consumed by the compressed folder
1.  After the compression finishes, on the General tab, note the Size on Disk
    in MB: \______________, and then select **OK**.    
2.  Notice that the Admin folder is now represented a compressed folder icon.
3.  Close all open windows

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have compressed a folder with files.

# Practice Lab: Enabling Disk Quotas

## Summary

To prevent specific users from using to much disk space disk quota can be
established.

### Scenario

You discover that some of your colleagues are using a high amount of disk
storage on the E: drive of LON-CL1. This is preventing other users from saving
their files. You decide to create disk quotas of 500 MB with a warning set at
250 MB, and ask Ada Russell to test if the configuration is correct.

 
### Task 1: Create disk quotas

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password
    **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  Select the **File Explorer** icon on the taskbar.

3.  In the File Explorer window, right-click **Allfiles (E:),** and then select
    **Properties**.

4.  Select the **Quota tab**, and then select **Show Quota Settings**

5.  In the Quota Settings for Allfiles (E:) window select the **Enable quota
    management** check box and select the **Deny disk space to users exceeding
    quota limit** check box.

6.  Select **Limit disk space to**, in the Limit disk space to text box, **type
    500,** and then in the Set warning level to text box, **type 250**.

7.  Select **MB** as the unit for both values.

8.  In the Properties window, select **OK,** and then in the Disk Quota window,
    select **OK**.

9.  Right-click **Start**, select **Shut down or sign out**, and then select
    **Restart**.

10. Note that LON-CL1 will restart now

### Task 2: Create test files

1.  Sign in as the user **Adatum\\ada** with the password **Pa55w.rd.**

2.  Select **Start**, and then type **cmd**. Press **Enter**.

3.  At the command prompt type the following five commands:

>   E:

>   MKDIR research

>   CD research

>   Fsutil file createnew file1.txt 209715200

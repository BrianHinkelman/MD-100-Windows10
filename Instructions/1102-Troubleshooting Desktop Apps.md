# Practice Lab:  Troubleshooting Desktop Apps  

## Summary
During this lab you will learn how to troubleshoot AppLocker policies.

### Scenario
Your manager has come to you indicating that there are reports of staff in
one department who are installing unauthorized programs. Your manager
indicates that the AppLocker policies in place should be preventing this.
You need to investigate why they are not working. \\\\lon-dc1\\labfiles\\Apps\\XmlNotepad.msi is available to test as an app that should not be possible to install. 

### Task 1: Review the help-desk Incident Record  ###

1.  Read the Additional Information section of the incident record in the
    Student Handbook exercise scenario.

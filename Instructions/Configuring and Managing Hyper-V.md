# Practice Lab: Configuring and Managing Hyper-V

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how to create a virtual machine in Hyper-V and modify
its settings using PowerShell.


### Scenario

To test a new application you need to setup a virtual machine on your Hyper-V
server LON-HOST1 and modify its settings to fit to the requirements of the
application. Before you install the application you test if you can revert the
VM to an checkpoint as a backup solution in case the install fails.

 

### Task 1: Creating a virtual machine in Hyper-V

1.  Sign in to **LON-HOST1** as **ADATUM\\Administrator** with the password
    **Pa55w.rd.**

2.  In the taskbar select the **Hyper V Manager** icon.

3.  In the Hyper V Manager window select **New**, and then select **Virtual
    Machine**.

4.  In the New Virtual Machine Wizard window select **Next**, then enter
    **LON-TEST** in the Name field and select **Next**.

5.  Select **Generation 1** and select **Next**. Leave the default startup
    memory and select **Next**.  
    In the Connection list select **External network**, and select Next.

6.  In the Size box enter **75**, and select **Next.**

7.  On the Installation Options page, leave the default to install the operating
    system later, and select **Next** then select **Finish**.

 

### Task 2: Add an ISO file to a VM

1.  In Hyper-V Manager, select LON-TEST.

2.  In the Actions pane, select **Settings**.

3.  In the Settings window select **IDE Controller 1** on the left.

4.  Select **DVD Drive** and then select **Add**.

5.  In the Location drop-down, select a location number not already in use.

6.  In the Media area, select the Image file option, and select **Browse**.

7.  Browse to **C:\\Labfiles**, select **Windows.is**o and select **Open**.

8.  Select **OK** to close the Settings window.

9.  Right-click on LON-TEST and select **Start**.

>    

### Task 3: Managing virtual machine settings with PowerShell

1.  Right-click **Start** and select **Windows Powershell (Admin)**.

2.  At the PowerShell window, type the following command and then press
    **Enter**:

>   Get-VM LON-Test \| Set-VMMemory -StartUpBytes 2GB

1.  Confirm that for LON-Test the StartUpBytes is now set to 2GB.

2.  At the PowerShell window, type the following command and then press
    **Enter**:

>   Get-VM LON-Test \| Add-VMNetworkAdapter -SwitchName "External Network"

1.  Confirm that LON-Test has now an additional network adapter that is
    connected to the virtual switch "External Network".

2.  Close the PowerShell window.

 

### Task 4: Creating a snapshot

1.  Switch to the Hyper V Manager window.

2.  In the Virtual machine area select **LON-CL5** and then select **Settings.**

3.  In the navigation area select **Network Adapter.**

4.  In the Network Adapter settings, in the Virtual switch drop-down select
    "**not connected**", and then select **OK.**  
    **Note:** *This is done to prevent Windows from updating, which would
    lengthen the time of the lab.*

5.  In the Virtual machine area select **LON-CL5** and then select
    **Checkpoint.**  
    **Note:** *Creation of the checkpoint may take a couple of minutes.*

6.  Once the snapshot is created select **OK.**  
    **Note:** *In the checkpoint area you can now see the snapshot.*

7.  Select **Connect.**

8.  On **LON-CL5** inside the Virtual Machine Connection Window in the taskbar
    select the **File Explorer** icon.

9.  Navigate to the **C:\\Users\\Student** folder. Right-click the **Documents**
    folder, and then select **Delete**.

10. Close the Virtual Machine Connection window.

11. Select **Revert.**

12. In the Revert Virtual Machine Window select **Revert.**

13. Select **Start.**

14. Select **Connect.**

15. On **LON-CL5** inside the Virtual Machine Connection Window verify that the
    **Documents** folder is available again.

16. Close all open windows.

 

**Results:** After finishing the exercise you have created a Hyper V virtual
machine and managed its settings.

## Summary
In this lab you will learn how to manage the settings of Windows Update.


## Exercise 1: Configuring Updates for a Single Device

3.  In the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window, type the following command,
    and then press Enter:
`  Set-Service wuauserv -Startuptype Manual`

## Exercise 2: Configuring Updates with GPOs

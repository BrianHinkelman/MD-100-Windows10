# Practice Lab: Using Conditions to Control Access and Effective Permissions

## Summary
In this lab you will learn how to use conditions to dynamically control access to files based on specific criteria.


### Scenario
IT, Marketing, and Research all use LON-CL1, but require different permissions for the data they use. You've been instructed to create two folders in E:\Data; A Research folder that can only be accessible by users in the Research Department, an IT folder that can only by accessible by US based employees in the IT group.


### Task 1: Configure conditions to control access 
1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password
    **Pa55w.rd**
2.  Select the **File Explorer** icon on the taskbar.
3.  In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, expand **AllFiles (E:)**, and
    then select **Data**. In the details pane, right-click the **empty space**,
    select **New**, select **Folder**, and **type Research** as the new folder
    name.
4.  Right-click **Research**, select **Properties**, select the **Sharing tab**,
    and then select **Advanced Sharing**.
5.  In the Advanced Sharing dialog box, select the **Share this folder check
    box**, and then select **Permissions**.
6.  In the Permissions for Research dialog box, in the Permissions for Everyone
    section, select the **Change check box** in the Allow column, and then select
    **OK** twice.
7.  In the Research Properties dialog box, select the **Security tab**, select
    **Advanced**, and then verify that all permissions entries are inherited
    from E:\\.
8.  In the Advanced Security Settings for Research dialog box, select **Users
    (LON-CL1\\Users)**, and then select **Remove**. Read the text in the Windows
    Security dialog box that appears, select **OK**
9.  Select **Disable inheritance**.
10. In the Block Inheritance dialog box, select **Convert inherited permissions
    into explicit permissions on this object**, and then verify that all
    permissions entries are set explicitly at this level because their
    permission inheritance is set to None.
11. In the Advanced Security Settings for Research dialog box, select **Users
    (LON-CL1\\Users)**, and then select **Remove**. 
    _**Note**: The entry for Users is now removed from the Permission entries because    it was explicitly set at this level._
12. Verify that **Authenticated Users** is selected, and then select **Edit**.
13. In the Permission Entry for Research dialog box, select **Add a condition**,
    and compose the following expression: **User department Equals Value
    research**. You will need to type research manually in the last box. Select
    **OK** twice, then click **Close**. 
	_**Note**: A claim type for the department attribute was preconfigured for the purpose of this lab._
14. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, select **Data**, right-click
    **IT**, select **Properties**, select the **Security tab**, and then select
    **Advanced**.
15. In the Advanced Security Settings for IT dialog box, select **IT
    (ADATUM\\it)**, and then select **Edit**.

    compose the following expression: **User c Equals Value US**. You will
    need to type US manually in the last field. select **OK** three times.
    _**Note**: A claim type for the c (country) attribute was preconfigured for the purpose of     this lab._
	17. Select **OK** twice, then click **Close** to close the IT Properties window.

### Task 2: Test conditions to control access 
1.  **Switch to LON-CL2**
2.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\beth** with the password **Pa55w.rd**
3.  Select the **File Explorer** icon on the taskbar.
4.  In File Explorer, type **\\\\LON-CL1** in the Address bar, and then press **Enter**.
5.  In the details pane, double-click **Research**. Read the text in the Network Error dialog box,
    and then select **Close**.
6.  Select **Start**, type **cmd** and then select **Command Prompt**.
7.  At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press **Enter**
    `whoami /claims`8.  Review the output, and then **close** the command prompt.

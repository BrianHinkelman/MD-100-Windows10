# Practice Lab: Configuring UAC

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how to modify the settings for the User Account

standard user, he or she can enter the credentials of an administrator account
to gain elevated privileges. You also want to restrict the execution of unsigned
applications.


### Task 1: Modify UAC prompts

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password
    **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  In the **Type here to search** box on the taskbar, type **gpedit.msc**, and
    then press Enter.

3.  In the Local Group Policy Editor, expand **Computer Configuration**, expand
    **Windows Settings**, expand **Security Settings**, expand **Local
    Policies**, and then select **Security Options**.

4.  In the results pane, double-click **User Account Control: Behavior of the
    elevation prompt for standard users**.

5.  In the **User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard
    users** dialog box, select the **Prompt for credentials** drop down list,
    select **Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop**, and then select
    **OK**.

6.  In the results pane, double-click **User Account Control: Only elevate
    executables that are signed and validated**.

7.  In the **User Account Control: Only elevate executables that are signed and
    validated** dialog box, select **Enabled**, and then select **OK**.

8.  In the results pane, double-click **User Account Control: Behavior of the
    elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode**.

9.  In the **User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for
    administrators in Admin Approval Mode** dialog box, select the **Prompt for
